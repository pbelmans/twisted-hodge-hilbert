# Twisted Hodge numbers for Hilbert schemes of points

This package computes twisted Hodge numbers for Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces
in terms of the cohomology of powers of line bundles on surfaces.

We implement the _twisted Hodge number conjecture_ as stated in Conjecture E of [2309.06244]
and subsequently proven in [Fu].
